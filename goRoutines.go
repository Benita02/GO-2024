/*
Issues with Shared Resources
When credit() and debit() run concurrently, unpredictable results occur because they both access balance without waiting for each other. This is known as a race condition. In the output, youâ€™ll see inconsistent results like a balance of 200 after crediting when it should be 300, or other errors in sequence.*/
