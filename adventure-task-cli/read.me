I will be building this cli app and simultaneously learning how to build powerful CLI apps 
# Wrote read.me with chatgpt and I will be making a lot of edits 

Here’s a detailed `README.md` for your **Task Adventure Journal CLI** project, formatted with appropriate markdown symbols:

# Task Adventure Journal CLI

A gamified CLI app that transforms your daily tasks into fun quests, combining productivity with role-playing game mechanics. Track your progress, level up your skills, write mission reports, and unlock new adventures as you complete tasks.

## Features

- **Quest Mapping**: View and complete tasks treated as quests. Tasks are associated with difficulty, rewards, and a progress map.
- **Skill Leveling**: Earn XP for completing tasks and level up various skills (e.g., Strength, Intelligence, Creativity).
- **Mission Reports**: Write and save mission reports after completing each task to reflect on your journey.
- **Character Development**: Track progress in character traits like Strength, Intelligence, Creativity, etc.
- **Persistence**: Saves your tasks, mission reports, and character progress for future sessions.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Go 1.18+](https://golang.org/dl/) — for compiling and running the application.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-adventure-journal-cli.git
   cd task-adventure-journal-cli
   ```

2. Build the app:

   ```bash
   go build -o journal .
   ```

   This will create an executable file called `journal`.

## How to Use

### 1. **Start Your Adventure**

To initialize your adventure, run:

```bash
./journal start
```

This will ask for your character's name and set up your initial skills.

### 2. **Complete Tasks and Earn XP**

Each task is treated as a quest with a difficulty level. To mark a task as completed:

```bash
./journal complete <task_name>
```

Completing tasks earns you XP and may unlock new quests or abilities.

### 3. **View Character Stats**

To check your current progress, including your level and XP, run:

```bash
./journal stats
```

This will display your character's stats and progress.

### 4. **Write a Mission Report**

After completing a task, you’ll be prompted to write a short report on your mission. To write your report:

```bash
./journal report
```

Your mission report will be saved for future review.

### 5. **Unlock New Quests**

As you complete tasks and level up, new quests will become available. To see your available quests:

```bash
./journal unlock
```

### 6. **View Your Quest Map**

As tasks are completed, new regions of the map will be unlocked. You can view your current quest map using:

```bash
./journal map
```

This will display an ASCII-style map with regions representing your progress.
